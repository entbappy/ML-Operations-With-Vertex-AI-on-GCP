These are different summaries of the the same information.\n","- `/commits` retrieves all commits for a repository, but not files\n","- `/commits/sha` where `sha` is the sha for a commit will retrieve the files associated with the individual commit\n","- `/contributors` a weekly summary of commits, additions, deletions for each contributor\n","- `/stats/code_frequency` is a weekly history of additions and deletions summarized\n","- `/stats/commit_activity` has the last year of weekly data for commits \n","\n","The most granualar levels is using `/commits` and then `/commits/sha` to retrieve timestamped file level information within commits.  This data could then be rolled up to all other levels in reporting.\n","\n","Approach notes:\n","- I prefer to not convert date/times to formats in pandas and instead save this as a step in BigQuery.  Why? Loading a dataframe to BigQuery has a middle layer where the data gets serialized and transferred.  This middle step is another set of format conversions that can impact dates/times.  This can cause errors when later appending to the same BigQuery tables even when the dataframe matches the original identically.
